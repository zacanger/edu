This is where I put little projects I've done while learning one thing or
another. Nothing in here is serious code meant to be used by anyone else.

Organization here is meant to be intuitive, for me at least. Git history is a
little strange because sometimes other repos get pulled in (add the other one as
a remote, fetch, merge with allow-unrelated-histories, move to a subdirectory).
Doesn't matter because nothing in here is meant to be used by anyone else, it's
just to keep track of things I've learned over the years.

Licenses vary; anything without a license, you can assume is MIT.
