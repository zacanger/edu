# TODO

* Remove all other keybinds
* Remove all, or at least most, config options
    * This should negate the need for YAML parsing
    * Remove config monitoring
* Collapse repo structure to just one src dir
* Consider porting to native macOS gui toolkit later on
* Remove cursor changing when typing (just pick one style and keep it there)
* Go through and read everything and find more stuff to delete
* Remove scrolling and history
* Remove padding
